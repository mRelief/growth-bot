Hi, I’m growth-bot! I am tasked with helping mRelief track our growth. I will deliver weekly, monthly, and quarterly announcements automatically but, I can also deliver information whenever you want it. 

Here are some useful commands that will help us communicate.
* @growthbot hi/hello/hey/howdy 
        - I am always listening and would love to say hello!  
* @growthbot annual/quarter/month/week
        - With this command , I will report our growth metrics for the specified time period.
* @growthbot update 
        - With this command I will give you all of the growth-metrics I have available. 
          This will include annual, quarterly, monthly, \n and weekly growth as well as 
          mRelief’s quarterly and yearly growth percentage
